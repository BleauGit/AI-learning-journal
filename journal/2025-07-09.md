Week 1: Foundations of Advanced Prompt Engineering

My Goal: Deepen my understanding of prompt engineering, focusing on advanced techniques to elicit better responses from Large Language Models (LLMs).

Achieved Learning Goals: This week, I significantly enhanced my prompt engineering capabilities. I gained a practical understanding of various prompt patterns, including few-shot learning for in-context examples, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for complex reasoning, and persona-based prompting for tailored outputs. I also explored the critical importance of clear instructions and negative constraints in prompt design, which are essential for robust AI automation.

Key Takeaways: Effective prompt engineering is foundational for reliable AI automation. Mastering these techniques allows for more precise control over LLM behavior and output, directly impacting the quality and consistency of automated workflows.



Day 1: Prompt Design Principles & Clarity

My Focus: Understanding the core principles of effective prompt design.

Task:
Watch videos on clarity, specificity, and conciseness in prompt engineering.
Experiment with simple prompts, focusing on making instructions unambiguous.
Practice using delimiters (e.g., """, ---) to separate instructions from context.

Quiz:
Why is clarity crucial in prompt engineering?
R: Providing clear and concise inputs for the model reduces the chances of it producing incorrect or irrelevant responses and guides it towards your desired outcome. Clear prompt does not equal short prompt, in many cases providing more detail in your input will improve the output. 

Give an example of how delimiters can improve a prompt.
R: Delimiters can help avoid ‘prompt injections’ and make it clear which instructions the model must follow.

Day 2: Few-Shot Prompting

Focus: Learning and applying few-shot prompting for in-context learning.

Task:
Understand the concept of few-shot learning by watching examples.
Design prompts that include 2-3 examples to guide the LLM's response.
Experiment with different example sets to see how they influence output.

Quiz:
What is the primary purpose of few-shot examples in a prompt?
R: To help make the model better understand my requests and guide it to provide me with a more relevant output. 

When might few-shot prompting be more effective than zero-shot prompting?
R: When we need the model to provide a more complex and nuanced output, that relies on more than just its training data and its understanding of the task we’ve given it.
